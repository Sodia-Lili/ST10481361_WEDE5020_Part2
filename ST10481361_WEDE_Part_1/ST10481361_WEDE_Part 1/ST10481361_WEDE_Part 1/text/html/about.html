        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <!--Company Story-->
        <p>SaniSide is a small business, run by an anime enthusiast, which specialises in creating anime themed swimsuits.<br>
           SaniSide originated from the owner's love for the beach, looking cute and anime beach episodes.<br>
           What began as a hobby shared on TikTok for fun turned into a business opportunity, and SaniSide was born.<br>
           The name SaniSide is a play on the word "Sunnyside".</p>

           <!--Our Values-->
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>

        <p> SaniSide dreams of  being the momentum that moves designers away from the usual "slap a picture on a T-shirt" approach,<br>
            by providing the anime community with higher quality anime merchandise that anime fans can proudly wear.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>SaniSide aims to expand its business to potential international clients and showcase in-stock products to current clients in a catalogue-style format.<br>
           The company also seeks to improve accessibility for all clients and introduce new product offerings to test customer interest.</p>
